* blackhole fs
FUSE overlay filesystem that doesn't keep data, but metadata.

** Build
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make
#+END_SRC

** Run
Run bhfs with the subdir module. This causes the paths passed to the
FUSE opts to change to a subdir of your choosing. Otherwise =/= will
be mounted.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./bhfs -d -o modules=subdir -o subdir=$(readlink -f ./backing-dir) /mountpoint
#+END_SRC
